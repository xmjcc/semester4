# Request verbs that may be sent to a web server

# GET requests a specific resource in its entirety
# HEAD requests a specific resource without the body content. Useful for caching purposes or to check if the document exist at all
# POST adds content, messages, or data to a new page under an existing web resource
# OPTIONS shows users which HTTP methods are available for a specific URL
# PUT directly modifies an existing web resource or creates a new URI if need be
# DELETE gets rid of a specified resource
# TRACE shows users any changes or additions made to a web resource
# CONNECT converts the request connection to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel
# PATCH partially modifies a web resource

# All HTTP servers use the GET and HEAD methods, but not all support the rest of these request methods.
